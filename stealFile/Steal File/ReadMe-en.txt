2. General Notes

================================================================================

2.1. Display/Performance Settings

Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six® Siege supports high resolution textures. Note that setting the texture
quality to Very High requires 4 GB of VRAM and setting it to Ultra requires 6 GB
of VRAM.

The Graphical Settings can impact the memory usage of the game. If your computer
lacks RAM memory, these settings should be lowered down accordingly.

There are some video card drivers that may cause flickering and disappearing 
objects. It is important to make sure the latest available drivers are installed. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Optimal Settings

When launching the game for the first time, the game will attempt to detect the 
optimal settings for your system. This may take a few seconds. If the game is 
unable to fully identify your computer, then the optimal setting is going to be 
medium or high.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3. Uplay PC

This game requires a one-time online activation via Uplay PC.

Create a new Uplay account in the Uplay application or at Uplay.com or use your 
existing Uplay account and the Unique Key that came with your game to bind the
game to your account.

Launching the game after this one-time activation is possible in online and
offline mode.  Not all game functionality is available in Offline Mode.

For Uplay licenses see the installation directory of the Uplay application and 
check the data\resources\LICENSES.TXT file
