This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights in VC and VG.
<br>VC and VG do not have an equivalent value in real currency and do not act as a substitute for real currency. You are prohibited from converting VC and VG into a unit of value outside of the Software, such as actual currency or actual goods. You acknowledge and agree that Psyonix may revise or take action that impacts the perceived value of or purchase price for any VC and/or VG at any time except as prohibited by applicable law. VC and VG do not incur fees for non-use; provided, however, that the license granted hereunder to VC and VG will terminate in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Software documentation, when Psyonix ceases providing the Software, or this Agreement is otherwise terminated.

This online service has been sublicensed to you by the Software Store. Psyonix may offer discounts or promotions on the purchase of VC, and such discounts and promotions may be modified or discontinued by Psyonix at any time without notice to you. Upon completing an authorized purchase of VC from a Software Store, the amount of purchased VC will be credited to your User Account. Psyonix shall establish a maximum amount you may spend to purchase VC per transaction and/or per day, which may vary depending on the associated Software. Psyonix, in its sole discretion, may impose additional limits on the amount of VC you may purchase or use, how you may use VC, and the maximum balance of VC that may be credited to your User Account. You are solely responsible for all VC purchases made through your User Account regardless of whether or not authorized by you.
<br>(C) You can access and view your available VC and VG in your User Account when logged into your User Account.

While Psyonix strives to make all such calculations on a consistent and reasonable basis, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Psyonix’s determination of the available VC and VG in your User Account is final, unless you can provide documentation to Psyonix that such calculation was or is intentionally incorrect.
<br>(D) All purchased in-game Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods may be consumed or lost by players in the course of gameplay according to the game’s rules applicable to currency and goods, which may vary depending on the associated Software. VC and VG may only be used within the Software, and Psyonix, in its sole discretion, may limit use of VC and/or VG to a single game. The authorized uses and purposes of VC and VG may change at any time. Your available VC and/or VG as shown in your User Account will be reduced each time you use VC and/or VG within the Software. The use of any VC and/or VG constitutes a demand against and withdrawal from your available VC and/or VG in your User Account. You must have sufficient available VC and/or VG in your User Account in order to complete a transaction within the Software. VC and/or VG in your User Account may be reduced without notice upon the occurrence of certain events related to your use of the Software. You are responsible for all uses of VC and/or VG made through your User Account, regardless of whether or not authorized by you. You must notify Psyonix immediately upon discovering the unauthorized use of any VC and/or VG made through your User Account by submitting a request to https://support.rocketleague.com
<br>(E) VC and VG may only be redeemed for in-game goods and services. You may not sell, lease, license, or rent VC or VG. VC and VG may only be redeemed for in-game goods or services and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value or other goods from Psyonix or any other person or entity at any time, except as expressly provided herein or otherwise required by applicable law. VC and VG have no cash value, and neither Psyonix nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange your VC or VG for anything of value, including, but not limited to, real currency.
<br>(F) All purchases of VC and VG are final and under no circumstances will such purchases be refundable, transferable, or exchangeable. Except as prohibited by applicable law, Psyonix has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify, suspend, and/or eliminate such VC and/or VG as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and Psyonix shall have no liability to you or anyone else for the exercise of such rights.
<br>(G) Any transferring, trading, selling, or exchanging of any VC or VG to anyone, other than in gameplay using the Software as expressly authorized by Psyonix (“Unauthorized Transactions”), including, but not limited to, among other users of the Software, is not sanctioned by Psyonix and is strictly forbidden. Psyonix reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate, suspend, or modify your User Account and your VC and VG and terminate this Agreement if you engage in, assist in, or request any Unauthorized Transactions. All users who participate in such activities do so at their own risk and hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless Psyonix, its partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees, and agents from all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from such actions. You acknowledge that Psyonix may request that the applicable Software Store stop, suspend, terminate, discontinue, or reverse any Unauthorized Transaction, regardless of when such Unauthorized Transaction occurred (or has yet to occur) when it suspects or has evidence of fraud, violations of this Agreement, violations of any applicable law or regulation, or any intentional act designed to interfere or that otherwise has the effect of or may have the effect of intervening in any way with the operation of the Software. If Psyonix believes or has any reason to suspect that you have engaged in an Unauthorized Transaction, you further agree that Psyonix may, in its sole discretion, restrict your access to your available VC and VG in your User Account or terminate or suspend your User Account and your rights to any VC, VG, and other items associated with your User Account.
