{$PSYONIX PRIVACY POLICY!}
<br>Psyonix LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Psyonix”, “we”, “our” or “us”), is committed to maximizing your experience on our Services. This Psyonix Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered about you online through our Services. We hope this disclosure will help increase your confidence in our Services to enhance your experience. Psyonix is a subsidiary of Epic Games. To learn more about privacy at Psyonix, please keep reading below. If you’d like to read more about privacy at Epic Games, be sure to check out the Epic Games Privacy Policy here.
Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through our Services. It does not apply to information that you may submit to us offline, or to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link, or third party platforms from which you access the Services (such as PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, or Switch) (the “Third Party Platforms”).
<br>Remember that your use of Psyonix’s Services is at all times subject to our Terms of Use https://psyonix.com/tou/, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.
<br>“Personally Identifiable Information” is information that can be used, either on its own or together with other information, to uniquely identify you or from which you can be identified such as your name, email address, certain demographic information (such as age, gender and ZIP code), or credit card number.
<br>{$(1) What types of information does Psyonix collect and how will it be used?!}
<br>Psyonix will only use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you with Psyonix products and services, or to communicate with you about such products and services. If you choose to make content or a document public, we recommend you redact any and all references to people and addresses, as we can’t protect public data and we are not responsible for any violation of privacy law you may be liable for.
The following information is automatically collected when you use our game services: IP address, unique platform-specific identifier, unique identifier specifically for your Services account. We also may collect additional information including, the type of operating system, gameplay attempts, progression and results, country of your device, and identification of crashes and defects. We process the data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services. Specifically, we use the data to, create and manage user accounts, provide support and assistance for the Services, fulfill user requests, comply with our legal or contractual obligations, and protect against or deter fraudulent, illegal or harmful actions.
<br>We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including Personally Identifiable Information.
This information is collected during game registration, or other online information service we may offer, or when contacting us. Our Services contain links through which an online user can contact us. We collect Personally Identifiable Information contained in this communication for the purpose of responding to a user’s questions and/or comments.
<br>We may also collect Personally Identifiable Information from third parties (for example, from social media platforms) and other publicly available sources. We do this to interact with you on social media platforms, help support our marketing initiatives, and improve our Services. Your privacy settings on the third party’s platforms control what information they share with us (for example, your username, country, the number of your followers, and other information you have made available on the platform). Please make sure you’re comfortable with what they might share by reviewing their privacy policies, and if applicable, updating your privacy settings directly on their platform.
<br>No matter what method we use to collect Personally Identifiable Information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives (provided that, on balance, these legitimate business objectives do not prejudice your own privacy) or otherwise permitted by applicable law.
<br>{$(2) Children’s Privacy!}
<br>Psyonix’s Services are intended to be appropriate for general audiences and are not directed to children (usually considered to be under 13, depending on where you reside). Psyonix does not intentionally collect personal information from children without seeking any required parental approval in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, such as the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
<br>If a user indicates to us that they are a COPPA minor, we’ll require that user to complete a parental approval process before continuing to access the relevant Psyonix Services. This process is designed to notify parents that their child has requested access to the Psyonix Services, inform them about Psyonix’s privacy practices, offer them the opportunity to approve Psyonix’s collection and use of their child’s information as described in this policy, and describe the controls that we make available to them. 
Parents are generally free to change or revoke the choices they’ve previously made and can review the personal information associated with their child or request that we delete their child’s information from our systems. To submit these requests or ask us any other questions you may have about how we handle your child’s personal information, please see “How to Contact Us” below.
<br>Authorized child users otherwise have access to the same Psyonix Services as other users. They can generally play games (such as Rocket League), and access communications and social features.
<br>We may collect unique device identifier information about users, without knowledge of their ages, as described in more detail elsewhere in this policy.
<br>{$(3) What happens if I refuse to provide my Personally Identifiable Information to Psyonix?!}
<br>If you choose not to submit Personally Identifiable Information when requested, you may not be able to access certain areas or portions of our Services and you may limit the products and services we can provide you or they may not be personalized based on your preferences.
<br>{$(4) Does Psyonix use cookies or other means to collect information?!}
<br>We may collect some information about you by using data collection technology, so that it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you come to our websites, your IP address is collected so that we know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. We may also transfer to your browser or device a “cookie,” which is a small file or record-keeping device that may be stored on your device and that allows Psyonix to recognize your device and that tells us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. This information may be used to make our Services more interesting and useful to you. Additionally, we may combine this information with other information to identify a user in order to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use, or to protect our Services or other users of the Services. We do not collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.
<br>We may collect technical information about your use of the Service through the use of tracking technologies and analytics. By way of example, data we may collect includes the following analytics:
<br>how many times you access the Service;
<br>traffic data;
<br>the devices that you use to access the Service;
<br>your internet service provider; and
<br>the actions you take when playing the Service.
<br>{$(5) With whom does Psyonix share my Personally Identifiable Information?!}
<br>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information we have collected about you, in personally identifiable form, unless:
<br>doing so is appropriate to carry out your own request or you have otherwise consented to such disclosure or otherwise permitted by applicable law;
<br>we believe it is needed to enforce our Terms of Use;
<br>we believe we are required to do so by law or to comply with legal process;
<br>we believe it is needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;
<br>it is needed to protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.
<br>The Services are operated in the United States. Specifically, if you are a resident of the European Union (“E.U.”), you should be aware that your Personally Identifiable Information will be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to the United States or other countries outside the EEA, the laws of which may be deemed by the E.U. to have inadequate data protection. Information we transfer from the EEA to the United States is subject to appropriate safeguards under applicable law.
<br>We do not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties except as we expressly state below:
<br>We may aggregate and/or anonymize data about you (such that it no longer specifically identifies you as an individual identifiable person), and we may use that information and share it with third parties to help improve the Services and such third parties’ products and services.
<br>From time to time, we may employ and share your Personally Identifiable Information with vendors who use it solely to provide support and services to us (e.g., technical support and network delivery). We only authorize these entities to use your Personally Identifiable Information for the purpose of providing services to us, and these entities have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the Personally Identifiable Information they obtain from us.
<br>As a member of the Epic Games family of companies, we may share user information with our Epic Games affiliates to support our services and operations worldwide. To learn more about Epic’s privacy practices, click here.

<br>If you wish to review, change, correct, update, or delete any Personally Identifiable Information that we may have collected about you, please contact us as set forth below in Section 10. Certain information may not be editable or deleteable.
<br>{$(7) What safeguards does Psyonix use to protect my Personally Identifiable Information?!}
<br>We maintain appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information we collect from all users. Personally Identifiable Information collected by us is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and are only accessible by authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
<br>{$(8) What if I am a European resident?!}

<br>For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.
Where applicable, this section is intended to supplement, and not replace, the rest of this Privacy Policy. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict.
<br>If you have any questions about this section or whether any of this section applies to you, please contact us as set forth below in Section 10.
<br>We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, to prevent fraud and illegal activity (including reserving the right to disclose your identity to any third party claiming violation of intellectual property, and working with console operators to assist with fraud prevention), and other processing grounds such as complying with a legal obligation, or necessary for a task carried out in the public interest. as further described below:
<br>{!Other uses of your information!}
<br>We keep your information confidential, but we may disclose it to group members, personnel, suppliers or subcontractors; in relation to a merger or acquisition, as required by law; or as necessary to enforce or apply the terms of agreements and protect our rights, property or safety of Psyonix, our customers or others.
<br>{!Automated decision making!}
<br>We use automated decision-making methods which do not involve human involvement to process your information only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.
We process your personal information via automated decision-making methods in order to identify users who are in violation of our Terms of Service. Our automated decision-making methods are designed to detect violations by looking out for excessive, unusual, or negative behaviors related to activities such as using inappropriate language, bullying, and cheating.
<br>If users are determined to be or suspected of being in violation of our Terms of Service, actions may be taken and we may block or suspend users from the Service. In this scenario the user will be notified of the outcome and will have the right to obtain human intervention to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.
<br>{!How long we retain your Personal Data!}
<br>We may retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you Services and for 24 months after you close your account, or for longer periods, where we may retain such Personal Data according to applicable law. In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.
<br>{!Your rights regarding Personal Data!}
<br>Under the GDPR, you have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including access, rectification, erasure, objection and right to file a complaint. For more information about these rights, or to submit a related request, please contact us as set forth below in Section 10.
